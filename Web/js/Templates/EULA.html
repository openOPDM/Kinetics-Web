                    href="https://opdm.kineticsfoundation.org/kineticsweb/#info/terms-of-service">Terms</a> sets forth
            the further details of the dispute resolution and arbitration procedures under this EULA.
        </li>
        <li><b>MISCELLANEOUS</b>. This EULA and the Terms are the entire agreement between you and the Foundation, and
            supersede any and all prior agreements, negotiations, or other communications between you and Foundation,
            whether oral or written, with respect to the subject matter hereof, and, except as expressly provided
            herein, cannot be modified except in writing signed by both parties. You may not export or re-export the App
            without (a) the prior written consent of the Foundation; and (b) complying with applicable export control
            laws and obtaining any necessary permits and licenses. In the event that any provision of this EULA is held
            to be invalid or unenforceable, then: (y) such provision shall be deemed reformed to the extent strictly
            necessary to render such provision valid and enforceable, or if not capable of such reformation shall be
            deemed severed from this EULA; and (z) the validity and enforceability of all of the other provisions hereof
            shall in no way be affected or impaired thereby. You may not assign this EULA, whether expressly or by
            operation of law, without the prior written consent of the Foundation, including in connection with a merger
            or change of control, and any such attempted assignment shall be void and of no effect. The Foundation may
            assign this EULA without restriction and without any notice to you or consent from you. Subject to the
            foregoing, this EULA shall be binding on the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
            The failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, a right, power or remedy provided in this EULA or by law
            shall not constitute a waiver of that right, power or remedy. The Foundation's waiver of any obligation or
            breach of this EULA shall not operate as a waiver of any other obligation or subsequent breach of the EULA.
        </li>
        <li><b>NOTICE REGARDING APPLE</b>. You acknowledge that this EULA is between you and the Foundation only, not
            with Apple, and Apple is not responsible for the Service and the content thereof. Apple has no obligation
            whatsoever to furnish any maintenance and support services with respect to the Service. In the event of any
            failure of the App to conform to any applicable warranty, then you may notify Apple and Apple will refund
            any applicable purchase price for the App to you; and, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,
            Apple has no other warranty obligation whatsoever with respect to the Service. Apple is not responsible for
            addressing any claims by you or any third party relating to the Service or your possession and/or use of the

            to conform to any applicable legal or regulatory requirement; and (iii) claims arising under consumer
            protection or similar legislation. Apple is not responsible for the investigation, defense, settlement and
            discharge of any third party claim that the Service and/or your possession and use of the App infringe that
            third party's intellectual property rights. You agree to comply with any applicable third party terms, when
            using the Service. Apple, and Apple's subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of this EULA, and upon
            your acceptance of this EULA, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to
            enforce this EULA against you as a third party beneficiary of this EULA. You hereby represent and warrant
            that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been
            designated by the U.S. Government as a "terrorist supporting" country; and (ii) you are not listed on any
            U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.
